//  This example is to illustrate the case of a transmission measurement. Transm1.C

//hand-made calculations and the results of Litrani. The over-simplification concerns the
//following points :
//
//  (1) - The beam is issued from a point, not from a surface
//  (2) - The aperture of the Beam is 0
//  (3) - The detector is perfect, without quantum efficiency or limitation in acceptance.
//  (4) - Material PbWO4 is treated as isotropic and not negative birefringent.

//made of air and containing a source of light, and below an other TSBRIK also made of air
